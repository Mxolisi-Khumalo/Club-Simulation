Club Simulation – Concurrency in Action
A concurrency-driven simulation of a nightclub environment using Java

About the Project
The Club Simulation is a Java program that models a real-life nightclub environment while showcasing the use of concurrency and synchronization techniques. Think of it as a virtual club where patrons (clubgoers) enter, enjoy themselves, and leave — all while the program ensures no chaos occurs at the doors or on the dance floor.
This project was built as part of a Concurrency Assignment (2023) to demonstrate:
- Thread safety
- Deadlock prevention
- Synchronization techniques
- Real-world concurrency concepts in a fun and interactive way

Features
- Realistic Patron Behaviour – Clubgoers queue outside if the venue is full and enter only when space frees up.
- Limited Capacity – Inside the club, the number of people never exceeds the set maximum.
- Activities & Movement – Patrons can:
   - Get drinks at the bar
   - Wander around the club
   - Dance on the floor

Fair & Safe Simulation
- Only one person can enter/exit at a time
- Patrons keep safe “distance” from each other on a grid
- Strict deadlock prevention & synchronized movement

Interactive Controls
- Start Button – Launch the simulation
- Pause/Resume Button – Freeze and continue activity safely
- Quit Button – End the program gracefully

Usage
Prerequisites
- Java 8+ installed on your system
- make installed (for running via Makefile)

Run the Simulation
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Mxolisi-Khumalo/Club-Simulation.git
   cd Club-Simulation
2. (Optional) Adjust command line inputs in the run method of the Makefile to customize your simulation.
3. Start the simulation with:
   make run
4. Use the buttons in the simulation window to manage the club:
▶️ Start – Begin the simulation
⏸️ Pause/Resume – Control flow without breaking the program
❌ Quit – End session

Technical Details
This simulation demonstrates how concurrency is handled in Java using:
- Synchronization (synchronized, wait(), notify()) – Prevents multiple patrons from entering the same door at once.
- Latches – Ensures the simulation only starts when triggered by the user.
- Atomic Variables (AtomicBoolean) – Used to safely pause/resume operations.
- Thread-Safe Movement Rules – Patrons move step-by-step, avoiding overlap.
- Deadlock Prevention – Ensures smooth flow so all threads eventually progress (no "frozen club").
This setup models real concurrency challenges like thread synchronization, fairness, and resource sharing, which developers also face in fields like server design, distributed systems, and gaming.

This project was created as an educational tool to explore concurrency fundamentals in a practical, engaging way.

Future Ideas
- Some potential improvements to make the club even more fun:
- Support for multiple entrances & exits
- Different patron behaviours/personalities
- Dynamic club capacity that changes over time
- Visualization improvements with animations

Contribute / Feedback

Closing Note
This project isn’t just about coding — it’s about showing how computing concepts like threads, synchronization, and resource management can be easily applied to real-world analogies. After all, managing a nightclub full of people isn’t too different from managing simultaneous users in a distributed system.

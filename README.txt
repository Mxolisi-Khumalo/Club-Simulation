# Project Name: Club Simulation

## Description

The club simulation program simulates a club environment, much like in real life. 

## Features

- **Club Goer:** A club goer can enter the club, unless the maximum capacity is reached, then it must wait outside the club.
                 Once inside the club, a club goer can get drinks from the bar, wander around, or dance on the dance floor.
                 If a club goer leaves, a club goer may enter from the waiting line, thus reaching the maximum specified limit once again.
                 
## Usage

1. Download the file to a local storage space on your PC
2. Change the command line inputs in the 'run' method of the makefile, if you wish
3. Run the make file using the terminal command 'make run' to open the simulation window
4. Click on the 'start' button to begin the simulation
5. Use the 'pause' button to pause the simulation. This will change to a 'resume' button to allow you to resume the simulation
6. Click the 'quit' button to end the simulation and the program
